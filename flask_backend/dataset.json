Founded in 1979. 20 to 40 million pounds of fresh produce is saved each year by the Society of St. Andrew (SoSA) and donated to feed the hungry nationwide. SoSA's Gleaning Network uses tens of thousands of volunteers to glean farmers' fields and orchards after harvest for nutritious produce that would otherwise be plowed under or left to rot. SoSA's Potato & Produce Project salvages truckloads of perfectly good but commercially unmarketable potatoes and other produce donated by members of the agricultural community. All of this food is then delivered and donated to food banks, pantries, soup kitchens, shelters and other critical service agencies in the 48 contiguous states. These agencies, in turn, distribute the food directly to the needy. SoSA's Harvest of Hope program educates people about the hunger problem and encourages them to make lifelong commitments to being part of the solution. The Society of St. Andrew is a faith-based ecumenical nonprofit organization adhering to the highest standards of good stewardship. It maintains an operational overhead of under 10%, resulting in more than 90 cents of every donated dollar going directly to providing food for the hungry.",

And it was 1995 when she vowed to herself that \u2018nobody should ever have to worry about having enough to eat\u2019 thereafter. Lisa started her community service in her hometown Brewton, Al by preparing and delivering hot lunches for the elderly and the disabled. As she became more aware of the hunger crisis that prevailed in society, she also started a Rolling Grocery Store on her van and delivered essential groceries and vegetables to people who couldn\u2019t afford them. She also started offering a free feeding program in her restaurant and started Brewton\u2019s first Thanksgiving Day and Christmas Day dinners. Then came into existence, Carlisa Inc. in 2002, a non-profit food bank, in fact Brewton\u2019s first food bank to be open to the public seven days a week. Along with feeding the seniors and disabled citizens of Brewton, Carlisa Inc. also provides hot lunches for students and the community by providing hot meals in Carlisa's ministry restaurant Drexell and Honeybee's Donations Only Restaurant at 109 Lee Street Street where all are welcome to come in and enjoy a home cooked meal.",

Rescue Ranch currently positively impacts the lives of more than 2000 dogs every year, by taking in between 500-700+ dogs and rehoming more than 500 while providing others with medical, transport, food, training, evacuation and other assistance. The organization also offers donation-funded community assistance programs and free socialization classes. \n\nRescue Ranch is a no-kill shelter that relies on donations from the community and local businesses, as well as grants from foundations and organizations. It does not receive funding from any State, County or City agencies. Proceeds from the Rescue Ranch Thrift Store also help cover some of the general operational costs. \n\nDesignated Dog Evacuation Center For Siskiyou County:\nRescue Ranch has been the designated dog evacuation center for Siskiyou County since 2020. During the 2021 Lava Fire, the adoption center took in 214 dogs over and above its regular contingent of about 40 residents at the time. Most had been evacuated with their owners, but there were also a number displaced, unclaimed and severely injured dogs who were treated and eventually put up for adoption. In 2022 Rescue Ranch took in 159 dogs in less than three days for a total of 169 during the McKinney Fire, and 91 dogs a few weeks later during the Mill Fire, 71 of these in less than six hours.",

We encourage our students to develop intellectual, physical, and spiritual qualities so that they may use those gifts and talents to influence their community in a positive and productive manner. In addition to teaching self-defense, we strive to enrich the lives of the children and families we serve by providing a structured and stable environment.  \n\nWe believe that it is important and in the best interest of children (and adults) to be engaged, not only physically but also mentally, regardless of financial situation.  In order to achieve this goal, we offer rates on a sliding scale as well as scholarships to ensure that anyone who is interested has access to our services. We currently partner with Kids Club, the New Braunfels Food Bank, Communities in Schools and Connections to provide services for at-risk youth. Our goal is to build strong families and individuals in order to have a strong community. We hope to also motivate our students to, in turn, support that community through volunteerism and civic-mindedness.",

We provide free sustainably grown produce to schools, the food bank, and other non-profits that feed the poor.\n\n\nWe currently grow produce\u00a0on 1 out of 15 acres of public buffer land and soon we will build\u00a0a high-tech AgraTech solar light greenhouse (144' X 42'), using recycled, agricultural-grade water, which is otherwise discharged into the Bay.\u00a0 This recycled water is high in nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium and micronutrients providing free fertilizer. \u00a0Hence, we use\u00a0under-utilized resources to nearly eliminate 4 of the major costs of food production: Land, Water, Nutrients\u00a0and Transportation.\u00a0\n\n\u200b\n\n\u200b\n\n\u200b\n\n\u200b\n\n\u200b\n\n\u200b\n\n\u200b\n\n\u200b\n\n\n\n\nHANDS-ON STEM EDUCATION & JOB TRAINING\nOne of the goals of the farm is to educate.\u00a0 Every aspect of science touches a farm such as physics, soil science, hydrology, meteorology, and nutrition.\u00a0 We work\u00a0with local schools and community colleges and other groups to provide students and the rest of the community hands-on opportunities to learn.\u00a0\n\n\u200b\n\n\u200b\n\n\u200b\n\n\u200b\n\n\u200b\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT and JOB TRAINING\n\nClasses on the farm provide job skills training that is relevant to local businesses including hands-on STEM, safety, measurement, and the 21st Century Employability Skills needed to succeed in the workplace.\n\nWe mentor interns through the Workforce Investment Opportunity Act and other federal programs.\n\n\nENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION\nThe environment will also benefit because we are\u00a0rebuilding barren soil, planting crops that sequester carbon and clean the air and increasing\u00a0ground water.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\u200b\n\nNearly 1 trillion gallons of reclaimed water are discharged into the greater San Francisco Bay waterways each year.\u00a0This water is high in nitrogen and phosphorus which are\u00a0bad for the Bay, but great for agriculture, providing free fertilizer. \u00a0Recycled water\u00a0is approved\u00a0by the State of CA for organic agriculture.\n\n\u200b\n\n\u200b\n\n\u200b\n\n\u200b\n\n\u200b\n\n\u200b\n\nWe have dramatically reduced the carbon footprint of this food by growing and delivering locally with natural fertilizer and other sustainable methods. In particular, we will be using regenerative agricultural methods which will increase organic matter in our soil and\u00a0carbon sequestration in our soil.\n\n\nSCALABLE\nSanitary districts in San Francisco Bay Area discharge as much as a trillion gallons of water in a year into the Bay waterways.\u00a0 They also have thousands of acres of buffer land. \u00a0Our business model is scalable and once proven, can be replicated with other sanitary districts",

We strive to create a brighter future for these innocent beings through a comprehensive three-pillared approach encompassing rescue, foster, adoption, education, and community support programs.\n\nCentral to our mission is our dedicated rescue program, where our compassionate team of rabbit wranglers use their training to rescue and provide first aid to rabbits in need. We believe that every rabbit deserves a chance at a life filled with love and care, and we fervently work towards offering them a sanctuary away from the perils of abandonment.\n\nFoster care stands as a crucial pillar in our endeavor to rehabilitate and nurture rescued rabbits. By placing them our fully vetted, trained, and caring foster homes, we offer these rabbits an opportunity to heal both physically and emotionally. These loving environments provide them with a sense of security, fostering the trust and confidence they need to recover from their traumatic past and rekindle their innate joy and playfulness.\n\nThrough our adoption program, we embark on the fulfilling journey of finding the perfect forever homes for each rabbit under our care. We understand that a successful adoption is not merely about finding any home, but about ensuring a lifelong commitment of love and responsibility. Our stringent screening process and ongoing support for adopters are aimed at ensuring that each rabbit finds a home where they will be cherished as a beloved member of the family.\n\nWhile our efforts make a significant impact on an individual level, we are also committed to enacting positive systemic change through education such as our virtual bunny basics courses. By raising awareness about responsible rabbit ownership, proper care, and the devastating consequences of abandonment, we endeavor to build a compassionate and informed community that advocates for the welfare of these gentle creatures.\nIn our unwavering commitment to make a difference, we extend our support to the community through programs such as free rabbit food banks and low-cost vaccine clinics. By offering these vital resources, we aim to alleviate the financial burden on caregivers, ensuring that rabbits receive the nutrition and medical care they need to thrive.\nNone of our efforts would be possible without the support and collaboration of our community. The collective dedication of compassionate individuals, local businesses, and devoted volunteers fortifies our mission and fuels our unwavering determination to make a lasting impact.\nHouston Rabbit Resource stands as a resolute voice for the voiceless, pioneering a path towards a future where no rabbit is left abandoned or uncared for. With each rescue, each foster home, each adoption, and every educational initiative, we take a step closer to breaking the cycle of neglect and ushering in a new era of compassion and care for rabbits.",

Our strategy to achieve that goal is to find homeless and runaway youth, help them come in off the streets, and provide them the services they need to overcome their challenges.

Our goal is to work diligently to end the cycle of breeding/over population, relinquishing animals, abandonment, leaving them tethered in the back yard with no social interaction, and allowing the pets in Arizona to run free causing unending suffering.\n\nSaving Orphan Souls Rescue works in conjunction with our community to help reduce the euthanasia rate by educating the public on the utmost importance and benefits of spay/neuter clinics, along with immunization and licensing services offered by various entities throughout Maricopa County.\n\nPlease send an email to:  savingorphansouls@yahoo.com for further information, and help us reduce the overpopulation epidemic here in Arizona.\n\nIn addition to helping the abandoned animals in our care, we try to give back to the community.  Saving Orphan Souls Rescue often runs clothing and food drives for the homeless AND their pets.  We collect socks, shoes, pants, shirts, etc, as well as leashes, collars, harnesses, food, treats and booties for the dogs of the homeless and the working poor.

We also work on a variety of other issues, including the cruel killing of beavers, birds and other \"pests,\" and the abuse of backyard dogs. PETA works through public education, cruelty investigations, research, animal rescue, legislation, special events, celebrity involvement, and direct action.",

Most of our dogs and cats come from rural shelters in NC, SC, AL, TN, MS, VA, GA. We also work with shelters in India. Without rescue intervention the shelters are forced to euthanize anywhere between 50% and 90% of the animals that come in the front door. We also partner with shelters located in Virginia and Maryland. Our program takes a holistic approach to  rescue. OPH is much more than rescue. We have  programs to assist shelters in needs of resources with supplies as well as  community spay and neuter. Our children\u2019s education program is geared towards helping children understand about pet care and safe interactions.\nOur organization provides pet adoption services to families located in Virginia, Washington DC, Maryland, Southern Pennsylvania, and neighboring states. OPH does not operate a shelter or have a physical location. We rely on foster families who open their homes to give love and attention to each dog before finding a forever home. Through the foster care program, we are able to learn about each animal and their needs and we provide their potential and future adopters with this information. We believe in responsible adoptions and strive to work with each adopter to find a good match for their home and lifestyle. \n\nOperation Paws for Homes, a volunteer powered 501(c)(3) organization, is 100% donor funded. We receive no funding from federal, state, or county governments. As a result, we rely on donations and our adoption fees in order to save the dogs and cats in need that join our rescue organization.\n\nOur goal is to fulfill the dreams of dogs and cats who find themselves homeless or abandoned in shelters. Sadly, without our help, many of these adoptable animals would face euthanasia - usually within days or hours of arriving at the shelter. Each year we take in hundreds of wonderful animals who were left at shelters by no fault of their own. We work hard to unite them with forever families who will give them the life and love they deserve. Without the dedication of our incredible adopters, fosters, donors, and volunteers, we would be unable to fulfill this dream.",

            "description": "Beauty\u2019s Haven Farm & Equine Rescue, Inc. is a rescue, rehab, and re-home organization that was established in 2006. Our mission is to help equine in need, to educate the public about proper horse care, what to do if they come across a horse that is being abused or neglected, to provide assistance (when possible) to horse owners going through a short period of financial hardship, and to help humans through helping horses. We try to get youth involved \u2013 they are the horse owners of tomorrow. Awareness and education are key in helping our equine friends. Through helping horses, we hope to help people too.\n\nWe give horses that have been neglected, abused, and/or abandoned a chance to begin their life, again--without pain and worry, but with dignity and respect. We welcome horses that are no longer needed, wanted or useful to their owners and we place them in good homes. We don\u2019t feel there are \u201cunwanted\u201d horses--some are just \u201cmisplaced.\u201d We try to help as many as we can find a good, forever-home before they end up in the slaughter pipeline where they would be at high risk of being sold to kill buyers and trucked across the borders where they are slaughtered for human consumption. \n\nWe also network with other organizations and individuals to help horses. We offer sanctuary to a limited number of horses with special needs. We have taken in babies as young as two hours old, pregnant mares, and our oldest rescue was 43 yrs old! Age and breed to not matter. We often take horses that others would not take for various reasons such as requiring extensive and/or costly rehab \u2013 we feel they all deserve a chance. Quality of life is always a factor in determining the future of each horse. We are pro-life \u2013 we do not euthanize any equine to make room for another. \n\nWe have an excellent care team that includes professionals in traditional and holistic medicines, dentistry, equine podiatrists, etc. However, we do euthanize when it is in the best interest of the horse \u2013 we don\u2019t deny a peaceful and loving end to any equine that is suffering or has a poor or painful quality of life that can\u2019t be rehabilitated. We have taken in horses with birth defects, broken bones, mutilations, cancer, blindness, COPD, Cushing\u2019s disease, are extremely emaciated, and have other serious diseases. We also help other animals (dogs, cats, pigs, goats, etc.) in need on occasion.   \n\nIn 2012 Beauty\u2019s Haven was awarded Verified status by the Global Federation of Animal Sanctuaries (GFAS). GFAS is the only globally recognized organization that provides standards for identifying legitimate animal sanctuaries.  This status has been maintained.",

With the help of bed and breakfast inn partners, we provide opportunities for recuperative rest and therapeutic fellowship for caregivers who desperately need a few days away from their caregiving environment.   In Fall 2018, we purchased the nation's first respite inn in New Market, MD (The Terrace Guest House & Respite Inn). That is open year-round, every weekend, exclusively for parents & caregivers for only a small donation.  In Jan 2020, we purchased a 2nd signature respite inn in Mt. Airy, GA to support our Southeast Region families.   Longer term goals include owning more flagship respite inns in multiple regions.  In Virginia, we are planning a respite CAMPUS that will include an inn, a coffee shop, wine tasting spot, therapeutic rescue animal farm,  garden market, thrift shop, and other valuable community resources.",

Experts currently estimate as few as 3,500 exist in the wild, fewer than the world''s tiger population. As an \"umbrella\" or keystone species, snow leopard conservation has far-reaching importance as it leads to the protection of hundreds of other plants and animals sharing the cat''s ecosystem. The International Snow Leopard Trust is the oldest and largest organization focused solely on saving this important species. The Trust works nationally and internationally to raise awareness about endangered species, and to empower people living within snow leopard range to become stewards of their environment. To this end, the Trust conducts educational outreach, scientific research, and community-based conservation.",

We encourage the public to adopt stray and abandoned cats as indoor-only pets and practice responsible ownership. We also mediate with planned communities and multi-family developments to enact TNR (trap/neuter/release) efforts rather than extermination of stray cats on their properties. Through combined efforts with other local animal agencies we are working to make South Florida a No-Kill community. We also cooperate with and assist other local governmental agencies in animal hoarder situations.",

Our primary financial goal is to acquire sustainable funding to provide these noble animals with the dignity of allowing them to live out their lives while meeting both their psychological and their physical needs. We provide them with the best possible care and the loving interactions they so deserve. Our moral position is to advocate and participate in ongoing research to find a cure, vaccine or aide in creating a more accurate test for EIA. We offer aide by providing researchers with test tubes of blood samples, drawn by a licensed veterinarian for their work. It is also our intention to factually educate the public regarding EIA thus allowing us to dispel the myths and misconceptions that lead owners to think their only option is euthanasia. It is our ethical obligation to surrounding communities that we continue to give back to them in a worthwhile and enriching way by maintaining and enhancing our many programs that benefit local families, organizations and horse owners, thereby positively impacting the entire community.",

The situation was not the same when PAWS started as a young NGO giving first aid to injured animals on the streets. At then PAWS did not have an ambulance, but few dedicated members took on their bikes and the first aid box to avail help for the injured animals on the streets. Time passed by and today PAWS boasts of having a couple of full-fledged ambulances serving to the needs of helpless animals. It\u2019s no longer the same old PAWS. It has evolved to a degree where one can clearly say it has been a revolution, a certain youth movement where volunteers kept joining in the service of animals and the total number has surpassed beyond 200 and it\u2019s increasing every single day.   \n\nPAWS \u2013 a young NGO that was always determined to stand on its feet inspite of all the hard times.

We were founded in West Virginia at a time when no other organization existed to come to the aid of the horses, and we realize how important it is to expand the reach of rescue through out Appalachia. We know it is vital to assist counties' animal control and law enforcement officers, teach the public and become leaders in the equine industry if we are to change in equine welfare.\n\nHeart of Phoenix is a POWERFUL advocate for All Horses in Appalachia. Poverty in our region means the need for education and assistance is tremendous, and we work to meet those needs. The conditions we encounter in West Virginia are often shocking, yet with your help, we are changing everything for the better! Our team cares deeply about horses, awareness and education. We care about showing what rescued horses are capable of while we work on the roots of \"equine neglect\" where a future finds fewer horses in need. \n\nThis region has more long-term, extreme neglect than is found anywhere else in the nation. Abuse, deprivation from water, food and basic care frequently go on at unspeakable levels where horses are left to suffer for years, for decades. While there are many issues facing horses and advocates working at various issues; our focus here is to rescue those most forgotten: To make sure that they receive the rehab and training they need to become awesome equine partners for adopters: To lead the state in equine education: To make more Good horsemen and women, so fewer horses end up in need and more horses have suitable homes.\n\nThe horses of this region have a valuable voice thanks to your support of HOP. We hope you continue to listen to the stories of our horses and allow us to continue to change the lives of many more. You can help change everything for horses in Appalachia when you partner with HOP!\n\nWe know in order to see radical change, our organization must stay progressive and creative by expanding our programs, extending more education and empowering communities, law enforcement and horse owners.\n\nWhile we have saved hundreds of lives, there is much work still to do. We are ready to do it! We hope to impact thousands more in the coming years!\n\nBecause our high quality rehab and standard of care requires a solid financial budget and many hours of volunteer time, we are committed to sound financial management. We will not take in more horses than our funding allows. We intend to serve equines in Appalachia for many years to come.",

Homelessness affects every facet of a child's development, increasing the risk for developmental delays, learning disabilities, emotional and behavioral disorders, heath concerns, and deficient social skills.  Project Night Night believes that these devastating effects can be mitigated by receiving a good night's sleep.  Inadequate sleep can cause decreases in performance, concentration, learning, and health.  Sleep deprivation can also increase behavior and mood problems as well as memory lapses.  Children in homeless shelters do not have the luxury of falling asleep in the pristine conditions we, as parents, try to create for our children.  Instead, children in shelters often endure an overcrowded, noisy, and unfamiliar environment in their quest for sleep.  At Project Night Night, we hope that by receiving a package of familiar objects such as a security blanket, books, and a stuffed animal, homeless children will be able to have sweeter dreams.",

The shelter exists to provide humane sheltering and high quality medical care for stray, unwanted, abused and neglected animals and to find loving, lifelong homes for orphaned pets. Our staff is dedicated to finding good homes for adoptable pets and we continue to promote responsible pet ownership and to improve the quality of life for the animals and people in our community. The Shelter is supported entirely by donations from private individuals and through surrender and adoption fees. The Animal Shelter, Inc. does not receive support from the United Way or from federal, state or local governments. Our on-site veterinary clinic cares for over 4,000+ animals that come through yearly and provides a low/no cost spay/neuter, general wellness program assisting local animal control officers, shelters and breed rescues.\n\nPosition Statement \u2013 A leader in our field, The Animal Shelter Inc. of Sterling is a happy, clean, well run, family friendly animal shelter with progressive programs that improves lives by raising the bar for animal care in our shelter and community. We are an established organization committed to placing animals in caring homes through innovative programs and placement services.\n\nAt the Animal Shelter Inc. of Sterling we share a core belief that we will only help animals by working proactively and compassionately with people.

We strive to create a judgment-free and caring environment for all community members seeking our services, whether they are surrendering a pet, adopting or utilizing our low-cost services. This philosophy is shared with all employees and volunteers. We have a streamlined adoption process and have a more positive way of connecting people and animals. There are no lengthy applications and screening processes. Instead, we want to engage in conversation with prospective adopters. If we start from a perspective that people are coming to us with the best intentions, we will have a much better success rate of finding life-long matches.",

Danny & Ron\u2019s Rescue is unlike most other rescue organizations. Because an abused or neglected dog can only recover and learn to trust again when it is in a loving home, Danny and Ron have turned their own house into the ultimate safe haven. There, they personally care for injured and abused animals until they are ready for adoption. Each dog receives a wellness check from our veterinarian, is then spayed/neutered, vaccinated, microchipped, dewormed, groomed, and loved. But most important, each dog is treated as part of the family, fed organic dog food from its own bowl, and even allowed to sleep in the bed. The opportunity to live with humans and other dogs in a real home environment is the best way to prepare a dog for adoption and a life with a loving family. We are also proud to be one of the only organizations that do not charge a pre-set adoption fee and instead rely on an affordable donation from the adopter.",

She noticed another concerned citizen had been leaving food for them too and placed a note in a bowl. The note was found. They met and combined their efforts to rescue the many stray dogs dodging traffic. Their work continues today on a grander scale, striving to save the lives of unwanted, abused, and abandoned animals. Two by Two\u2019s goal is to care for these rescues until they find their forever homes, and educate the public about responsible pet care. Our animals are fully vetted, spayed or neutered and micro-chipped. They are treated regardless of age, breed, or medical cost. Two by Two Rescue receives no state funding or government assistance. We survive by the donations of caring people, fund raising, and adoption fees. Since we do not have a facility,   most of our pets are kept in private foster homes in Birmingham and the surrounding areas of Helena, Pelham, Hoover, and Alabaster, AL.",

            "description": "Kitten Rescue was founded in the spring of 1997 and has grown to become one of the largest and well-respected rescue groups in Los Angeles. We are a non-profit organization devoted to finding loving new homes for abandoned cats and kittens. \n\nWe are equally dedicated to giving the public vital information about responsible pet guardianship, care of kittens and cats, managing community cats colonies, and most importantly, the importance of spaying and neutering. Our website features information on cat rescue, care, and adoption for animal lovers all over the world.\n\nThe majority of our cats are cared for in foster homes until they are placed with adopters, who are screened carefully to ensure the stability and quality of an animal's new environment. Before going home, each cat or kitten is fixed, tested for Feline Leukemia and FIV, vaccinated, dewormed, treated for fleas and microchipped.  We also provide full medical care for the cats in our care until they are adopted.\n\nIn March 2006 Kitten Rescue purchased the Kitten Rescue Sanctuary, a private, no-kill shelter and boarding facility in Atwater Village, that can  house up to 150 cats. In 2016, we converted the front house of the Kitten Rescue Sanctuary to a full time Nursery, where we care for orphaned, unweaned kittens around the clock. Unweaned kittens brought into city shelters are euthanized within hours of intake if a foster home or rescue group cannot be found. The Nursery has increased our lifesaving ability tremendously.",

We believe that the welfare of our companion animals is an indication of the health of our society. We see the current welfare of our companion animals as a disease. To treat the symptoms of this disease, we rescue, rehabilitate, and rehome dachshunds in need. To treat the causes of this disease, we educate the public on compassionate dog guardianship of any breed. We want to have a deep, direct impact in a limited geographic area, rather than a small impact in a large geographic area. We raise as much as we spend. At least 90% of our funds are spent directly on medical care for dogs. We put the welfare of our dogs first. We will not take in a dog that we cannot adequately care for. We document our processes, so that our successes can be replicated with other groups. In this way we can have a broader geographic impact over time. \n Volunteers, foster homes and board members are all non-funded and unpaid.",

Our mission is rescuing, rehabilitating and rehoming dogs that come through theses shelters, with a focus on Pit Bulls.  We have several initiatives that help us in our endeavors such as pet adoption events that bring about public awareness and education about animal welfare. The PHR program consists of behavioral training, obedience training, and vetting to get these dogs in adoptable condition.  PHR saves hundreds of dogs every year that otherwise would have been euthanized either for lack of space and/or lack of veterinary care at the NYC Shelter System.\n\n\nOUR PHILOSOPHY\n\n\n\nPound Hounds Res-Q believes that every animal deserves a loving home. How that happens takes lots of work. We try to pair the animal with the best possible foster or adopter home available. We take into consideration the initial behavior evaluation and volunteer evaluation. We also consider the animal's environment at the shelter. It's not science, but it helps us pair us with the best possible pets/people.\n\nFurthermore, we then look at family dynamics. Are they active, are they quiet, etc?  This gives us a better perspective of what animals would be right for them and their lifestyle. We look at the total environment, kids, other pets, etc. It's not perfect, but it helps enormously in placing every animal with the right family. \n\nIt's truly a challenge, but it's something that we don't take lightly. It's a big effort but so rewarding in the long run.\n\nWe do not have a facility but rather rely on a network of committed loving foster homes that see these animals through to adoption. It is a selfless act and every single one of our fosters helps us save another precious life.",

Education is of the utmost importance concerning the well being of a parrot and its ability to successfully live with its human companions.\nIn conjunction with Bird Gardens of Naples, our sanctuary mission is to provide a permanent, safe, loving and disease free environment for unadoptable psittacine species. Bird gardens of Naples will provide shelter, medical and rehabilitative care to displaced and unadoptable parrots in a natural environment for those who have failed to thrive in a family setting. Each parrot will be evaluated individually, before placement into sanctuary, for its suitability as a sanctuary resident. Public education will be used to turn uninformed impulse buying opportunities into well informed adoption opportunities in hopes of eradicating the homeless parrot population.",

This safety net gives families facing domestic violence, financial turmoil, a health crisis, natural disaster, military service or other life crises time to restore their lives by caring for their animals until the family can be together again. Seer Farms provides for the animals on a temporary basis while the family deals with the crisis and reunites them once the family is able to care for their pets again.\n\tWe do not believe that giving up precious animals during difficult times is necessarily best for the animals or their human companions. We believe that families in crisis need time to repair their lives and that they benefit from the emotional support they derive from their pet and the peace of mind that comes from knowing their animals are being cared for while they themselves overcome their life crisis. To help families recover, Seer Farms provides resources and support that enables a family to navigate the barriers to their own self-sufficiency. These resources and support are also intended to assist pet-owning families in pre-crisis planning and preparation; helping them mitigate the impact of their crisis on their care of their pets.\n\tFounded in 2008, Seer Farms\u00a0has a unique perspective on animals and their people, and how to keep them together as a family during difficult times.  Our Out of Crisis program fills an important void in the human social services and animal care services offered in the mid-Atlantic and beyond. Our origin and ongoing service reflects our commitment to families with companion animals and the animals themselves. Seer Farms is a safe haven, providing the lifeline of time and compassion to families in crisis and their companion animals.",

As individuals, the members of this group believe strongly in offering equines of all breeds a second chance and a new beginning. \nWVHN targets our efforts primarily in West Virginia.\n\nAt WVHN we are committed to helping the horses that WE have the most to offer. That includes basic training. We help horses in danger because they have not received proper training. We help horses that exhibit behaviors that would otherwise limit their chances of finding a safe home. Not every horse that you see pass through our network will show the \"outward\" signs of the neglect they have faced. Untrained horses or horses with a \"bad reputation\" are destined for a short, cruel life. We are committed to getting them back on the right path. \n\nWVHN helps horses that are in need physically because of neglect as well. \n\nWVHN attends horse auctions in West Virginia to monitor for horses that may need physical or emotional rehabilitation. We also help other horses that come across our path through social media, animal control, etc. as space in our network allows. \n\nWVHN will help owners screen potential new homes for horses that they are no longer able or willing to keep. \n\nWVHN members share our knowledge, experience and resources to help improve the relationship between horses and horse owners in our region. We also educate our followers about important issues regarding equine welfare. \n\nWVHN is committed to taking all steps possible to make certain our horses are placed in safe and permanent homes. \n\nWest Virginia Horse Network, INC. is a relatively new group. We will only be able to accept a small number of horses into our \"network\" at any given time until we grow bigger. But if there is a horse in need we will do the best we can to help the horse find safe placement. \n\nWVHN will not take on more horses than we can handle financially. We will also not take on more horses than we have the time to properly care for. We spend FOCUSED one on one time with each and every horse, to make sure their nutritional, emotional, medical and training needs are being served. We form relationships with each horse. We feed their spirit, mind and body. \n\nWest Virginia Horse Network is committed to community leadership and education. We believe that by actively educating current and future horse owners about proper horse care we can help prevent horses from needing rescue in the first place. An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure. We also believe that by participating in and volunteering for community events that promote responsible horse ownership we can help change the culture and standards when it comes to the treatment of horses",

FHS provides temporary foster care and medical attention for homeless animals until permanent homes can be found.  \nFHS also helps to reduce the number of abandoned, abused and unwanted animals through education and spay/neuter. The Frisco Humane Society was formed on October 2001 by a group of experienced rescue workers. To date, FHS has saved over 10,000 animals and our goal is to save as many unwanted adoptable animals as we can from being euthanized in area shelters. We also want to prevent countless numbers of unwanted animals from being born through our spay/neuter program.  FHS rescues dogs and cats primarily from city run Animal Control Facilities. All animals in the FHS program live in foster homes until they can be placed permanently.

LDF also personally escorts many dogs from Mexico to the US that are going to new adoptive homes, or fosters them while searching for forever homes. Funds raised go to assist with flight fees, medical vetting and supplies, food and general care. Lost Dog Foundation is the parent organization for Help Tulum Dogs, a grass-roots rescue operation in Tulum, Mexico and funds all of the rescue efforts and vetting. Lost Dog Foundation focuses on helping those animals in the most dire need and orchestrating their adoption placement into quality forever homes.  LDF also helps other rescue groups in Mexico including Tierra de Animales Sanctuary (which LDF founder helped to get established in Cancun), Cause 4 Paws Rescue, Coco's Animal Welfare, and Isla Animals...LDF truly believes that rescues should help each other and assists whenever possible in donating critical funds or helping to transport dogs for adoption to the US and Canada.\nLDF works in the US to help dogs be transported along the East Coast (United States) from high kill shelters to rescues and foster homes that can give them new lives.  Each weekend, volunteers transport dogs to safety and to adopters. \nLDF works locally in Richmond to help dogs in critical need through rescuing and fostering, and also by donating for spay/neuter and vaccinations.   LDF partners with other local rescue organizations in community outreach, helping dogs who are chained on properties, and helps sponsor vaccine clinics in the Richmond area.   LDF works in the Richmond area to TNR feral cat populations also, and has trapped and spayed/neutered hundreds of homeless cats.  In this process, over a hundred kittens each year are rescued, rehabilitated and adopted to great homes.  Lost Dog Foundation is a 501(c)3 charity and all donations for donors in the US are 100% tax deductible.",

We offer a chance for them to recapture their brillance by giving them time to heal and recover physically as well as emotionally... They learn to be useful and loved again.\n\nWe provide each animal with the care, training, and space to recover, for however long they need. While our goal is to find lifelong, loving homes for our horses, those who have suffered too much in their past will remain with us as Sanctuary animals to live out their lives in a caring, comfortable fashion. If a horse cannot recover, they live with us while they are comfortable and will cross over with dignity and with friends by their side. Decisions are made based on what is best for each horse on an individual basis.\nEvery horse that comes into our rescue will receive immediate medical attention to address all immediate physical needs and they will receive ongoing veterinary and farrier care thereafter. A rehabilitation and training program is tailored for each horse to help them reach their full potential and to address the emotional and physical scars that cruelty or neglect has left on their lives.\n\nWe hope to educate the community on responsible equine stewardship, prevent future cruelty, and bring awareness of the need to end the inhumane slaughter of horses.\n\n*****",

We are \"Top Rated\" with GreatNonprofits and have earned a Platinum Seal of Transparency with GuideStar. Although our name includes the word Ranch, we DO NOT breed, sell, adopt out, show or compete. We simply enjoy the love, loyalty, friendship and companionship of our sanctuary family members. We are content feeding, grooming, caring for and spending quality time with them therefore we are well suited for sanctuary work and have over thirty years' experience in animal rescue and rehabilitation. Those who come into our care become permanent members of our sanctuary family and live out the remainder of their lives with us never knowing hunger, neglect, cruelty, fear or abandonment ever again. \n\nWe are a forever sanctuary for predominantly senior horses, dogs and cats who may be considered by some to be less desirable not only due to advanced age but also due to physical limitations, medical conditions and/or imperfections. We focus on rescuing the Arabian horse breed in particular as they are often stereotyped, misunderstood and discriminated against but we adore, understand and respect their distinctive traits and personalities. In addition, we transport and foster for other rescues and advocate for new and improved animal protection legislation as a means of improving the lives of more animals than we can possibly provide lifetime care for ourselves.",

At BARC, we strive to rescue homeless pets regardless of the circumstance, but place great emphasis on saving shelter pets in danger of being euthanized.  \n\nOnce rescued, we undertake a rigorous process to find our pets a permanent home with a loving, responsible and committed family.  To do so, we utilize a comprehensive adoption process that includes vetting the potential adopters as well as educating potential adopters on the responsibilities/seriousness of pet ownership.  By doing so, we hope to ensure our pets will never have to face the situation that lead them to us in the first place.\n\nAll animals in our care are spayed and neutered and receive any and all necessary veterinarian treatment and are placed in nurturing foster homes until they are ready to find their forever home.  At BARC, it is our mission to provide unwavering care and treatment for all animals, regardless of age, breed or other characteristics.  Furthermore, we remain committed to the well-being of our rescued pets even beyond the adoption process.  \n\nTo accomplish our goal of providing homeless and at need animals with a second chance, we strive to continuously foster relationships with area shelters and other rescue organizations to develop the network of support necessary to make our mission of providing a better life to pets in need an attainable goal.\nBarc Broken Arrow Rescue Corp. is a 501(c)(3) animal rescue group, incorporated Feb. 15, 2017.",

We seek to eradicate extreme poverty in East Africa, one family, one dairy goat at a time. Check out Bernadetta's story here https://youtu.be/AaMM1_6JXbc or in the videos on our page. \nWhy community development and not just relief? Simple. Relief, though temporarily helpful, is a quick-fix. Community development addresses the root of the problem, while fostering empowerment and transforming lives.\n\nWe start with one materially-poor family. We provide them a dairy goat along with veterinary support and agriculture training. We offer spiritual sustenance through the Gospel. We help them set goals. We watch them succeed. \n\n A goat is more than just an animal; it\u2019s like an efficient engine. Goats provide up to four liters of rich milk a day, which initially is used to sustain families, providing much-needed nutrition. Their manure fertilizes crops which doubles the harvest. Eventually, families can sell goat milk and use that income to send children to school, build safe and structurally-sound homes, start independent businesses and pay for medical expenses.",

For our veterinarian transparency, please contact Dr. Petrus, or our farrier, Tim Candelaria.  For a private tour of Pet Place International, please contact Joan at 949 683 5412.\n\nBear in mind, slander and harassment are illegal.  Think before you put something untrue into writing.  We will not tolerate harassment, slander, etc.\n\nOUR STATEMENT OF PURPOSE is to rescue horses, dogs, and cats, rehabilitate, if necessary, and match these animals with stable and loving people/families. It is also our purpose to educate the public on proper animal care and training through various informational events.  We have an application process and an adoption agreement that the adoptee must adhere to. If the adoption does not work out for any reason, Pet Place International, Inc. will take the animal back to be re-homed appropriately. Our goal is to find loving homes where adopted animals will be well-cared for. Our goal is to save animals from shelters, (especially those scheduled for euthanization), or from neglectful and/or abusive homes.  UPDATE:  Please see website for new programs and goals: www.petplaceintl.org.",

I pull every cat that is not adopted, reclaimed or rescued from the Wytheville Cat Shelter and after their health care is finished, adopt them out or provide permanent care for them at the sanctuary, if adoption is not an option due to special needs. Misfit Critter Farm & Sanctuary also provides assistance to the community by providing low cost spay/neuter, vaccinations, combo testing, rehabilitation, food, medicine, removal, trapping, transport, colony sterilization/vaccination and emergency medical services. Despite any diseases or illnesses, no cat is euthanizes unless all possible treatments have been extinguished, the cat's quality of life will remain poor and suffering is permanent. I also assist with neglect and abuse cases regarding any type of animal. The focus is on cats and farm animals/horses since this area is flooded with dog rescue groups and the kill rate at the nearby shelters for cats is near 100%. Also, we educate the community about disease/virus prevention, spay/neuter importance and animal care/health with our large online following and through brochures, flyers and posters. Adoption, meet & meow, and educational events take place as time/volunteering allows. We hope to bring light to many issues involving animals in this area and create a better educated, safer, distemper free, population controlled, actively proactive and compassionate community.",

Shelia and Marybeth joined forces and decided to concentrate their efforts on a small, rural animal control in Jasper County (specifically located in Monticello, Georgia). Jasper County is about 90 miles southeast of Atlanta, and although most of our foster homes are in the Atlanta area, we still do our best to save Jasper County dogs, as well as from other animal controls around Atlanta. \n\nIn the past 12 years , RMG has grown and saved the lives of more than 5,000 animals. We are an ALL-VOLUNTEER 501c(3) nonprofit rescue group licensed in the state of Georgia.\n\nRMG is a FOSTER BASED RESCUE - we do not have a facility - but we have a great foster team that constantly open their hearts and homes to take in the ones we save! \n\nRMG depends solely on voluntary donations and adoption fees to cover our vetting expenses. Donations and NEW FOSTER HOMES enable us to do what we do - and every dog we adopt OUT - allows us to save another. Over the years, we have collaborated with various rescues in the Northeast and we continue, on a case-by-case basis, to adopt some dogs North and in other areas of the United States. Every decision we make is centered around what is in the best interest of that dog, as our ultimate goal is to help all of our rescues live happy, healthy and vibrant lives.\n\nWe are grateful that you have found us and appreciate you spreading the word about what we do. Many employers do match donations made to non profits like ours. Please keep us in mind during any time of the year that you might be able to donate towards our mission. \n\nThank you!",

In the event an adoption fails, or a family must surrender their pet, 4Life will always keep an open door and the animal will be taken in.\n\n4Life is a non-profit, entirely volunteer-based organization located in Orange County California, and we rely on the generosity of our volunteers, donors, and fundraisers to operate.

In fact, we tend to be drawn to the poor little victims that need help the most. The ones that wouldn''t have a chance at a kill shelter because they need some rehabilitation time before they are ready for adoption. Every animal that finds HELP gets any medical treatment or rehabilitation that they require, no matter what the cost. This can put a strain on the pocketbook, especially since we work strictly off donations. But, we wouldn''t have it any other way. Help Humane Society also spends a great deal of manpower, energy and resources on Feral Cat TNR. HELP has volunteers who specialize in this field, and work tirelessly every weekend, trapping and transporting the cats to and from the vet clinic where they are tested, vaccinated, spayed and released back into the neighborhood they know as home. This effort not only stops 10000''s of homeless kittens from being born on the streets but also maintains colonies and provides many advantages for the community where they are living.",

Local animal shelters, hospitals, small farms, and other organizations who are boots on the ground rescuing animals during disasters are not getting the funds and supplies needed to assist to save the unusually high number of animals needing to be saved during disasters.\n\nNOTE: 79% of all households in the US own at least one dog or one cat.  But there is no system in place for families to bring their pets when disaster strikes.  As a result, people are forced to leave their animals behind to suffer and die. \nOur Vision\nTo create a permanent and universal system for housing animals during disasters. If the local  animal shelters and hospitals have funds and a venue to house the animals, many are willing and capable of  staying with family pets during the disaster until they can be reunited with their families.",

            "description": "Our Mission\nThe Service Dog Project is a non-profit, charity organization committed to breeding, training, and donating certified service dogs to people who experience difficulty with their balance or mobility.  Our mission is to create a partnership that enhances a recipient\u2019s quality of life as they attain greater independence.  In creating the partnership between Great Dane and recipient, SDP is dedicated to the values of respect, integrity, inclusion, compassion, collaboration, equality, and courage.  These principles endure within the organization and in its insistence on the value of diversity, in its strive to provide excellence to those in need, and in its dynamic engagement with the community.\n\nOur Great Danes are cared for equally, with the utmost compassion and respect.  The Service Dog Project stands by positive reinforcement training methods to ensure our dogs demonstrate gentility and dedication while supporting their partner.  This training method incorporates rewards such as praise and treats to encourage wanted behavior through repetition, rather than introducing fear or discomfort.  Upon demonstrating excellence, our dogs are carefully matched to a recipient based on their physical characteristics and personality, which ensures a constructive partnership that upholds SDP\u2019s values.\n\nOur second mission is to serve our local community.  SDP\u2019s farm is a destination for all ages \u2013 from teens seeking to fulfill community service, seniors in search of a meaningful task and social interaction, to military veterans who enjoy feeling useful and connected while helping out the farm.  The Service Dog Project also spreads compassion and collaboration in the community, where dogs and trainers visit schools, senior centers, and local events to provide much-needed smiles and comfort.",

Veteran, Senior, At Risk, BIPOC,  LGBTQ & homeless communities are over represented among the vulnerable, and we work hard  in hopes of easing suffering and enhancing quality of life for both animals and their people.\n \n\nIn rescue, simply \u201cvetting\u201d (spay/neuter, vaccinate, deworm) is not enough; simply housing them is not enough; we need to begin a brand new way of animal sheltering! We have been doing it differently for 2 decades now.  \n\n\nWe take in a smaller number of animals, and we take the time to address every aspect of their well-being, from nutrition (what they eat affects everything) to emotional health (how they feel affects everything) to behavior & training (how we engage affects everything). Everything is connected, we cannot address only part of the picture. Warehousing animals is not working (not for people either) and research shows the extreme negative effects repeatedly, yet it does not change on the scale it must if we are to actually be \u201crescuing\u201d these animals. \n \n\nAdopting a dog should never be a nightmare, dangerous, require 1000s of hours or dollars to be safe and content! The rescues and shelters are supposed to be addressing all of that BEFORE placing any animal up for adoption. Our system is only doing part of the work, and in too many cases that part is part of the problem. \n\n\nOur pledge: \n\n*We will not alter the reproductive status of juvenile or baby animals, as we now know the risks associated with this practice and the benefits do not outweigh the risks. We will alter our adoptable animals upon adoption or under contract. \n\n\n*Our pledge: We shall not place up for adoption animals that are a danger/threat to people or animals, regardless of the root cause. We will work to address the root cause whenever possible, and we will fight hard for the life of every animal. \n\n\n*Our pledge: We will stay current on the latest scientific research, seminars, symposiums, conferences and lectures as we are able and are members of and/or support organizations that promote methods that do not cause pain or fear, or use intimidation, coercion, violence or similar methods. We have been working with dogs for 2 decades and had the honor of learning from some truly great minds in all things dog; as a result we utilize evidence and compassion based methods in all our training and behavior programs.",

We believe that ALL veterans that honorably served their country should be entitled to support.\n\nThe veterans we serve struggle daily with the aftermath of their sacrifices they made on the battlefield. Most of us take for granted those sacrifices made and for those coping with visible and invisible injuries, we are here ensure that they are provided with a service at no cost. We advocate with local professionals and non-profits to partner with us to ensure the hero receives the best services available to ensure safe handling of a service animal in public.\n\nIn addition to the physical wounds, it is estimated as many as 400,000 service members live with the invisible wounds of war including combat-related stress, major depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder. Another 320,000 are believed to have experienced a traumatic brain injury while on deployment. So involvement in a non-traditional therapeutic setting with other veterans have proven successful many times and long lasting.\n\nWe have been founded on the principles that should a veteran need help and we have the ability to step in for a brief moment and truly assist with an issue, we will certainly attempt to make a difference in a heroes life. \n\nWe believe in honoring the donors faith in us to use their contributions to our organization exactly where we say we  use them. No Warrior without Help will not attempt to derail the trust given to us at face value and provide meaningless support that does nothing for our veterans. Nor will we use these contributions in a manner that conflicts with the values we believe in. No Warrior without Help is 100 percent volunteer and there is not a single wage earned for the tireless effort given to us by our team. Our volunteers receive compensation far greater than any financial gain can provide.\n\n We guarantee that we will not use any portion of our funds to support or promote violence, terrorist activity or related training of any kind, either directly or indirectly (including through support of other organizations or persons engaged in such activity). In addition, our organization affirms the nonprofit is not a charitable organization designated by the U.S. Treasury Department\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Control as Specially Designated Nationals or Blocked Persons.\nWe have Non-Discrimination Policies that apply to all projects or programs funded by the organization.

We have come together to build a community of Veterans and Active duty service members to support one another.\nThe Diving Devil Dogs of Arizona (DDD) and Cold Creek Ranch Military Ministry and Outreach (CCR) have teamed up to focus their collective efforts on the prevention of Veteran and military suicide, the support of Veteran and military families, and the passing on of lessons learned in the military and in combat, to communities in the United States. Our task is to provide rapid, meaningful, and lasting positive results to those who 1) have served in the military, 2) those who currently serve, and 3) those who are interested in serving (in any capacity, not just militarily) and/or their families.  Our purpose for doing this is to restore hope, unity, and joy to these same groups of people.  We do this through humor, camaraderie, networking, accountability, and requiring some type of investment from those we serve. We are building community, one step at a time.",

            "description": "To provide culturally appropriate services which enable youth and their families in East Santa Clara Valley to improve their lives.\n\nDescription of what your organization does, whom we serve, and major accomplishments: \nIn 1974, Alum Rock Counseling Center (ARCC) began its critical work by addressing the academic, social, and mental health needs of the at-risk youth and families, living in the extremely high-need area of Eastern Santa Clara Valley, CA.  Due to the lack of linguistically sensitive and culturally appropriate practitioners and services, many of the predominantly Spanish-speaking individuals in this region were ?falling through the cracks? of the legal, educational, and health systems into lives of poverty, academic failure, illness, incarceration, addiction, and victimization.  A group of active community members founded ARCC in the hopes of providing this community with the culturally proficient counseling and professional support they needed in order to lead healthier, safer, and more productive lives.  \n\nAlthough, today, there are other non-profit organizations providing mental health & specialized educational support services to Santa Clara County residents, ARCC is the only agency that serves youth (ages 0-19) with a specific focus on the East/Central San Jos\u00c3\u0192\u00c6\u2019\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a9 area, serving the highest percentage (over 80%) of Latino, immigrant, and monolingual clients in the region. For over 33 years, ARCC?s programs have helped to keep at-risk youths safe, in school, and drug- and violence-free.  Alum Rock Counseling Center serves 3,500 youth and their families a year, and currently has 40 full-time employees and over 100 volunteers, with 95% of direct services staff being culturally and linguistically reflective of the community it serves. Recently, ARCC was awarded Project Cornerstone?s Award in March 2008, acknowledging success in promoting Developmental Asset #41, Positive Cultural Identity. ARCC was chosen due the cultural competency of the staff and similar backgrounds and experiences that they share with clients served by the agency.  \n\nSince its inception, Alum Rock Counseling Center (ARCC) has addressed the damage of family conflict, school failure and delinquency among high-risk youth, producing responsible community members and a healthier, more vibrant East San Jose. ARCC offers practical, proven solutions to families when and where they need them most. Our services include counseling, 24/7 crisis intervention, mentoring, specialized educational support, case management, support groups and alternative-to-incarceration programs.  We employ a strategic service delivery system that is unique among service agencies, which places programs in homes, schools and community centers in order to maximize their impact and effectiveness.  ARCC embraces the youth of our community who are at highest risk for academic failure and a life in the criminal justice system?youth that, in many cases, the rest of the community has written off. The agency?s programs are distinctively tailored to the needs of East San Jose families, and provide a personal touch to go with our professional expertise.  Our staff and volunteers deliver outstanding, measurable results. \n\n?96% of all youth served by a gang intervention program in the 2006 fiscal year successfully halted their involvement with the juvenile justice system or avoided it altogether.  \n\n?92% of all youth served by a mobile crisis response program did not require follow-up interventions by police or juvenile justice authorities.",

We follow the parable of the Good Samaritan, as there are no requirements for our services. We constantly reinvent the wheel, and adapt quickly to make it work in any situation.\n\nThe faces of homelessness can change as well as each individual's circumstances. Our founder became homeless himself, and found that traditional shelters were not working, and did not address the needs of the homeless, especially Veterans. This in and of itself was discouraging, as our Veterans fought for the rights of all, not just themselves. The Founder feels that no one should lose those rights by becoming homeless. Many fought and also died for freedom in America.\n\nThe Mission in Citrus operates on love and a family atmosphere. Veterans, and many others who are homeless are helped regardless of their beliefs or unique situations. Many of the homeless Veterans have given up trusting our society, and have little access to shelter and services in rural settings. Based out of Citrus County, Florida, our program is designed for those who are less than perfect and know it, but want and need health, outreach, spiritual, and social services. \n\nWe seek to empower homeless Veterans of all ages to meet their own needs. Recognizing the uniqueness,dignity, and value of each person, we accept individuals as they are, in an affirming and compassionate manner, and call upon the larger community to the same mission. \nThe Mission provides basic and self-care supplies, free health care, housing and supportive services for the homeless Veterans that are the hardest to reach, including those who refuse to go into a shelter and live out in the rural wooded areas of our county. The Mission also provides referrals to other community agencies, such as child care providers and legal aid.   The Mission in Citrus Inc operates three shelters located in Crystal River, and Inverness, Florida. The Mission In Citrus strives to help all in need - regardless of their faith or lack of.  While we encourage, teach, and preach the Gospel, we force it upon no one. It is not a requirement for any of our services. \n\nAs Founder and Executive Director , I have worked for seven years to improve the help we give to others.That is between God and I. But there are several projects that need to be completed before God takes me home.Most of them concern Veterans, as they are becoming the new face of homelessness each day. In the past two weeks, we have taken in six new Veterans. Not good. \n\nI am asking for help in getting them help with disabilities, contacting Congressman,and funding to offer more services. Anyone can visit the shelter at 306 south Park Ave in Inverness at anytime and meet our homeless Veterans. One is a three combat tour Veteran who only gets 30% disability after being shot in the head. It appals me.. \nPlease help. Every little bit counts.God bless",

This is where Luke\u2019s Wings steps in to fill the gap for the months and years ahead.\n\nFamilies are completely on their own to travel back and forth between their everyday lives and their new reality. Luke\u2019s Wings provides complimentary airfare to wounded, ill, and injured service members, veterans and their loved ones keeping military families connected during recovery and rehabilitation. These flights bring mental, physical, emotional, and financial support, empowering wounded service members to overcome challenges they face every step of the way.\n\nWhile individual donations can be made directly through our website, www.lukeswings.org, Luke's Wings also encourages corporations to share in our thanks to our service men and women through corporate sponsorships.",

Operation Not Forgotten operates through peer-support groups called Vet Life Communities.\n\nWHAT IS A VET LIFE COMMUNITY\u2122? \n\nOperation Not Forgotten is a mission of Life Renewed International, a non-profit, 501(c) (3) organization, and was created to help veterans and their families achieve a better quality of life.  Operation Not Forgotten works through Vet Life Community,  a network of local weekly peer-based support meetings - the buddy system, veterans helping veterans, families helping families face to face - offering the tools necessary to assess needs and determine what, if any, help veterans and their families may require as they transition back into civilian life. Our Quality of Life Assessment instrument provides an accurate, graphic picture of the veteran\u2019s readjustment back into his family and offers our trained Life Coaches a blueprint to guide veterans\u2019 success.  Veterans also work in our Step By Step Twelve Step Journal  and apply new insights to the challenges they face as they rejoin society.\n\nAnother important aspect of Operation Not Forgotten Vet Life Communities is the renewed sense of brotherhood/sisterhood that veterans felt when they were in the military.   Vet Life Community is a place where veterans can meet other veterans and form new friendships with people who really understand; people who have \u201cbeen there\u201d.    Community members often get together for Sunday afternoon ball games, camping, televised sports, or even just a cup of coffee at a local coffee shop.  Families can come together for backyard cookouts, or barbeques,   hiking excursions, trips to the beach, or just sharing a meal \u2026 The important thing is there is someone there for veterans to reach out to; a buddy to \u201chave our six\u201d \u2013 a place to find support \u2026 a Vet Life Community.\n\nVet Life Community is designed to create a confidential, community-based meeting place. Meetings are free for all participating veterans and their loved ones.\n\nContact Information:  Steve Schiffman \u2013 steve@liferenewed.org",

It was founded as a community-based organization in Northeast Florida in 2019 under three premises \u2013 (1) that suicide is preventable, (2) that we must connect Veterans to resources they need before they slip into crisis, and (3) that the broader community can play a vital role in the effort.\n\nOver 6,000 U.S. military veterans have died by suicide each year since 2008, including more than 500 annually in Florida. Northeast Florida - Baker, Clay, Duval, Nassau, and St. Johns Counties - is home to 1,500,000 residents and 160,000 military veterans. In 2019, these counties lost 78 veterans to suicide, the highest annual count yet recorded. The rate of veteran suicides in 2019 in the region was 45 out of 100,000, which is more than twice the rate of civilian suicides.\n\nOur objective is to reduce Veteran suicides in targeted geographic areas by 25% over three years (compared to baseline year) by providing Veterans with easier access to upstream resources and services, including transition support, financial assistance, and mental health services. \n\nIn 2022, we expanded our programming statewide.",

Alpha Project's methodology is firmly entrenched in the idea that homeless individuals are an asset to the community when provided with opportunities rather than handouts.  Our programs inspire employment, independence, trust, and dignity by empowering our clients with jobs and appropriate information/referrals.  We are proud to offer a unique approach in social service in that we make our clients part of the solution.  We provide performance appraisals, disciplinary action, and feedback in regards to their temporary employment with Alpha Project.  Our unique approach is derived from the high unemployment recidivism rate that is apparent in basic job placement, which does not provide homeless individuals with the necessary acclamation period and support.",

They are intuitive and social with distinct personalities, attitudes and moods. Horses have defined roles within their herds. \n\nThey demonstrate and teach self-awareness, communication, trust, healthy boundaries, leadership, patience, assertiveness, play, affection and support. \n\nThe key is that horses are honest teachers with an uncanny ability to mirror human body language and behavior.\n\nEquine Experiential Education involves learning from a horse or horses through equine assisted activities. Through these activities, how you approach the equine related task(s) and what surfaces for you in the process, becomes a metaphor for other areas of your life\n\nHandsome Harry Mustang Ambassador\nHeartSoul Horses Helping Humans is excited to announce their mustang project which will be focused on public educational awareness programs. Harry and Dakota mission is to visit schools in the Nevada area and someday reach out into California\"s. Currently they attend public events and parades bringing a presence of the mustangs wherever they go.\n\nChanging Lives of Mustangs, One Mustang at a time\nOne goal of this project is to adopt a few mustangs every year, put them through our gentling and training programs, then adopt them out to qualified homes. \n\nThe mustangs that go through our program will be mustangs that have been taught to trust humans and are eager to begin the horse-human partnership.",

Examples include billboard ads, magazine ads, and radio and television commercials.
